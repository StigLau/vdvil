/**
 * The type to which this annotation is applied is thread-safe. This means that
 * no sequences of accesses (reads and writes to public fields, calls to public
 * methods) may put the object into an invalid state, regardless of the
 * interleaving of those actions by the runtime, and without requiring any
 * additional synchronization or coordination on the part of the caller. Even if
 * one or more {@link RegionLock} models has been developed to document the
 * locking policy of a class this annotation can help to clarify that the
 * overall class is thread-safe.
 * <p>
 * This annotation <em>does not</em> imply that a sequence made up of calls to
 * methods of this class or accesses to fields of this class are atomic. It is a
 * the responsibility of the caller to insure that such sequences execute
 * atomically.
 * <p>
 * This annotation is currently verified, <em>but not defined</em>, by
 * restricting how the fields of the class are declared and annotated. This is a
 * conservative, although easily understood, way to verify the
 * {@link ThreadSafe} assertion. Specifically, for a class annotated as
 * <code>&#064;ThreadSafe</code> to be verified, each field must be either
 * <ul>
 * <li>declared <code>final</code> and be "safe,"
 * <li>declared <code>volatile</code> and be "safe," or
 * <li>protected by a lock (by being a member of a region associated with a lock
 * via a <code>&#064;RegionLock</code> annotation) and be "safe."
 * </ul>
 * Where, by "safe" we mean that one of the following conditions is true:
 * <ul>
 * <li>The declared type is primitive.
 * <li>The declared type is annotated <code>&#064;ThreadSafe</code>.
 * <li>The declared type is annotated <code>&#064;Immutable</code>.
 * <li>The declared type is annotated <code>&#064;Containable</code> and the
 * field is either
 * <ul>
 * <li>Annotated <code>&#064;Unique</code> and the <code>Instance</code> region
 * is protected by a lock.
 * <li>Annotated <code>&#064;UniqueInRegion</code> such that each destination
 * region is protected by a lock.
 * </ul>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * {@link Immutable} objects are inherently thread-safe; they may be passed
 * between threads or published without synchronization. Therefore instances of
 * an {@link Immutable} type are also {@link ThreadSafe}, but not necessarily
 * visa versa.
 * <p>
 * Typically, subtypes of the annotated type must be explicitly annotated
 * <tt>&#064;ThreadSafe</tt> or (the more restrictive, but also thread-safe)
 * <tt>&#064;Immutable</tt>. It is a modeling error if they are not. This
 * annotation has two attributes, <tt>implementationOnly</tt> and
 * <tt>verify</tt>, that control how subtypes of an {@link ThreadSafe} type must
 * be annotated. The <tt>implementationOnly</tt> attribute indicates that the
 * implementation of the annotated class should be assured without making a
 * general statement about the visible behavior of the type or its subtypes.
 * There are several rules with regards to the <tt>implementationOnly</tt>
 * attribute on {@link ThreadSafe} types:
 * <ol>
 * <li>The <tt>implementationOnly</tt> attribute must be {@code false} when
 * {@link ThreadSafe} appears on an interface, because interfaces do not have an
 * implementation.</li>
 * <li>The subinterfaces of an interface annotated with {@link ThreadSafe} must
 * be annotated with {@link ThreadSafe}; classes that implement an interface
 * annotated with {@link ThreadSafe} must be annotated with
 * <tt>&#064;ThreadSafe(implementationOnly=false)</tt>.</li>
 * <li>The superclass of a class annotated with
 * <tt>&#064;ThreadSafe(implementationOnly=true)</tt> must be annotated with
 * <tt>&#064;ThreadSafe(implementationOnly=true)</tt>; there are no constraints
 * on the subclasses.</li>
 * <li>The superclass of a class annotated with
 * <tt>&#064;ThreadSafe(implementationOnly=false)</tt> must be annotated with
 * either <tt>&#064;ThreadSafe(implementationOnly=false)</tt> or
 * <tt>&#064;ThreadSafe(implementationOnly=true)</tt>; the subclasses must be
 * annotated with <tt>&#064;ThreadSafe(implementationOnly=false)</tt>.</li>
 * <li>The annotation {@link ThreadSafe} may be replaced with the annotation
 * {@link Immutable} in subtypes because all {@link Immutable} types are
 * {@link ThreadSafe} as well.</li>
 * </ol>
 * Finally, it may be possible to implement a class that satisfies the semantics
 * of {@link ThreadSafe}, but that is not verifiable using the syntactic and
 * annotation constraints described above. For this case, we provide the
 * "escape hatch" of turning off tool verification for the annotation with the
 * <tt>verify</tt> attribute. For example,
 * <tt>&#064;ThreadSafe(verify=false)</tt> would skip tool verification
 * entirely.
 * 
 * <p>A type may not be annotated with both <code>&#064;ThreadSafe</code>
 * and <code>&#064;NotThreadSafe</code>.
 * 
 * <h3>Relationship with <code>&#064;Immutable</code></h3>
 * 
 * <p>Thread safety and immutability are two points along the same axis.  This set of 
 * annotations can actually describe three points along the axis:
 * <dl>
 *   <dt><code>&#064;Mutable</code> and <code>&#064;NotThreadSafe</code>
 *   <dd>This is the same as being unannotated, or just
 *   <code>&#064;Mutable</code>, or just <code>&#064;NotThreadSafe</code>.  The type
 *   contains mutable state that is not safe to access concurrently from
 *   multiple threads.
 *   
 *   <dt><code>&#064;Mutable</code> and <code>&#064;ThreadSafe</code>
 *   <dd>This is the same as <code>&#064;ThreadSafe</code>.  The type contains mutable 
 *   state that is safe to access concurrently from multiple threads.
 *   
 *   <dt><code>&#064;Immutable</code> and <code>&#064;ThreadSafe</code>
 *   <dd>This is the same as <code>&#064;Immutable</code>.  The type contains no mutable
 *   state, and is thus safe to access concurrently from multiple threads.
 * </dl>
 * 
 * <p>The combination <code>&#064;Immutable</code> and <code>&#064;NotThreadSafe</code> is a
 * modeling error because an immutable type is obviously thread safe.  
 * 
 * <h3>Semantics:</h3>
 * 
 * All accesses to a non-<code>final</code>, non-<code>volatile</code> region of
 * an instance of the annotated class occur either when
 * <ul>
 * <li>The instance is under construction and only accessible by a single
 * thread&mdash;the one that invoked the constructor&mdash;or
 * <li>The lock associated with the region is held by the thread making the
 * access.
 * </ul>
 * Further, this assertion imposes that all the state referenced by instances of
 * the annotated class, transitively, be likewise protected.
 * 
 * <h3>Examples:</h3>
 * 
 * The <code>Point</code> class is thread-safe because its fields are
 * <code>final</code> and of primitive type.
 * 
 * <pre>
 * &#064;ThreadSafe
 * &#064;Containable
 * public class Point {
 *   private final int x;
 * 
 *   private final int y;
 * 
 *   &#064;Unique(&quot;return&quot;)
 *   &#064;RegionEffects(&quot;none&quot;)
 *   public Point(int x, int y) {
 *     this.x = x;
 *     this.y = y;
 *   }
 * 
 *   &#064;Borrowed(&quot;this&quot;)
 *   &#064;RegionEffects(&quot;none&quot;)
 *   &#064;Unique(&quot;return&quot;)
 *   public Point translate(int dx, int dy) {
 *     return new Point(x + dx, y + dy);
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The <code>Rectangle</code> class is thread-safe because its fields are
 * <code>final</code> and of a type annotated <code>&#064;ThreadSafe</code>:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * &#064;ThreadSafe
 * &#064;Containable
 * public class Rectangle {
 *   &#064;Unique
 *   private final Point topLeft;
 * 
 *   &#064;Unique
 *   private final Point bottomRight;
 * 
 *   &#064;Unique(&quot;return&quot;)
 *   &#064;RegionEffects(&quot;none&quot;)
 *   public Rectangle(@Unique Point a, @Unique Point b) {
 *     topLeft = a;
 *     bottomRight = b;
 *   }
 * 
 *   &#064;Borrowed(&quot;this&quot;)
 *   &#064;RegionEffects(&quot;none&quot;)
 *   &#064;Unique(&quot;return&quot;)
 *   public Rectangle translate(int dx, int dy) {
 *     return new Rectangle(topLeft.translate(dx, dy), bottomRight.translate(dx, dy));
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Alternatively, we can create a mutable thread-safe <code>Rectangle</code>
 * class by protecting the state with a lock, and aggregating a containable
 * mutable, but not thread-safe, <code>Point</code> class:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * &#064;Containable
 * public class Point {
 *   private int x;
 *   private int y;
 * 
 *   &#064;Unique(&quot;return&quot;)
 *   &#064;RegionEffects(&quot;none&quot;)
 *   public Point(int x, int y) {
 *     this.x = x;
 *     this.y = y;
 *   }
 * 
 *   &#064;Borrowed(&quot;this&quot;)
 *   &#064;RegionEffects(&quot;writes Instance&quot;)
 *   public void translate(int dx, int dy) {
 *     x += dx;
 *     y += dy;
 *   }
 * }
 * 
 * &#064;ThreadSafe
 * &#064;RegionLock(&quot;Lock is this protects Instance&quot;)
 * public class Rectangle {
 *   &#064;Unique
 *   private final Point topLeft;
 * 
 *   &#064;Unique
 *   private final Point bottomRight;
 * 
 *   &#064;Unique(&quot;return&quot;)
 *   public Rectangle(int x1, int y1, int x2, int y2) {
 *     topLeft = new Point(x1, y1);
 *     bottomRight = new Point(x2, y2);
 *   }
 * 
 *   &#064;Borrowed(&quot;this&quot;)
 *   &#064;RegionEffects(&quot;writes Instance&quot;)
 *   public synchronized void translate(int dx, int dy) {
 *     topLeft.translate(dx, dy);
 *     bottomRight.translate(dx, dy);
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <h3>Javadoc usage notes:</h3>
 * 
 * This annotation may placed in Javadoc, which can be useful for Java 1.4 code
 * which does not include language support for annotations, via the
 * <code>&#064;annotate</code> tag.
 * 
 * <pre>
 * /**
 *  * &#064;annotate ThreadSafe
 *  * &#064;annotate RegionLock(&quot;Lock is this protects Instance&quot;)
 *  *&#047;
 * public class Rectangle {
 *   ...
 * }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <i>Implementation note:</i> This annotation is derived from
 * <code>&#064;ThreadSafe</code> proposed by Brian Goetz and Tim Peierls in the
 * book <i>Java Concurrency in Practice</i> (Addison-Wesley 2006) we have simply
 * adapted it to have semantics as a promise. Further, the annotation in
 * {@code net.jcip.annotations} may be used instead of this one with the same
 * tool behavior. One difference between the two annotations is that the
 * annotation in {@code com.surelogic} adds the <tt>implementationOnly</tt> and
 * <tt>verify</tt> attributes&mdash;these attributes can not be changed from
 * their default values if the the {@code net.jcip.annotations} annotation is
 * used. Another difference is that the annotation in
 * {@code net.jcip.annotations} has retention policy of
 * {@link java.lang.annotation.RetentionPolicy#RUNTIME} while the annotation in
 * {@code com.surelogic} has a retention policy of
 * {@link java.lang.annotation.RetentionPolicy#CLASS}.
