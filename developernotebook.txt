Notes when programming Vdvil

h2. Romjula 2009/2010
 * Immense cleanup job of old KPRO2007 project
 * Removed lots of stale code
 * Simplifyed usage of Vaudeville renderers and playback to a sleek sexy API
 * Moved project from internal to GitHub repository

Todo's
 * Some tests depend on .dvl and .mp3 files that should be part of the project so anyone can build without errors in tests
  * Introduce Psylteflesk .dvl/.mp3
 * Create API for describing how resources (.mp3s, videos aso) can be downloaded and locally cached, and referenced by the renderers.
 * FactorMagic should perhaps be removed!

 * Rewrite CompositionExample so it can be persisted to file
 * Move Domain into case class
 * Persistence to XML
 * Load compositions from web instead of from hardcoded

 * TaggerGUIScala should use the new improved downloader to fetch files
 * TaggerGUIScala should show URL of files and segment identifiers
 * Downloader should cater for .dvl's and mp3's, not songs. However, multiple songs should be added by outside GUI.. Not quite sure how to implement this...
