Notes when programming Vdvil

h2. Romjula 2009/2010
 * Immense cleanup job of old KPRO2007 project
 * Removed lots of stale code
 * Simplifyed usage of Vaudeville renderers and playback to a sleek sexy API
 * Moved project from internal to GitHub repository

Todo's
 * Some tests depend on .dvl and .mp3 files that should be part of the project so anyone can build without errors in tests
  * Introduce Psylteflesk .dvl/.mp3
 * Create API for describing how resources (.mp3s, videos aso) can be downloaded and locally cached, and referenced by the renderers.
 * FactorMagic should perhaps be removed!

 * Make a "downloading" Pane which downloads all the .vdl's and mp3's to disk while writing how this is doing
  ** Should perhaps add throtteling to allow only 1-2 files to be downloaded at once - Have noticed problems downloading several mp3's at once
 * Move Domain into case class
 * Persistence to XML
 * Load compositions from web instead of from hardcoded
