/**
 * Instances of the type to which this annotation is applied are immutable. This
 * means that its state cannot be seen to change by callers, which implies that
 * <ul>
 * <li>all public fields are {@code final},</li>
 * <li>all public final reference fields refer to other immutable
 * objects, and</li>
 * <li>constructors and methods do not publish references to any internal state
 * which is potentially mutable by the implementation.</li>
 * </ul>
 * Immutable objects may still have internal mutable state for purposes of
 * performance optimization; some state variables may be lazily computed, so
 * long as they are computed from immutable state and that callers cannot tell
 * the difference. Such practices may or may not be verifiable by a tool, such
 * as SureLogic JSure. (Use of the {@link Vouch} annotation can be used,
 * especially annotation of <tt>&#064;Vouch(&quot;Immutable&quot;)</tt> on a
 * field, to suppress overly conservative tool results.)
 * <p>
 * This annotation is currently verified, <em>but not defined</em>, by
 * restricting how the fields of the class are declared and annotated. This is a
 * conservative, although easily understood, way to verify the
 * {@link Immutable} assertion. Specifically, for a class annotated as
 * <code>&#064;Immutable</code> to be verified, each field must be
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Declared <code>final</code>; and
 *   <li>Be of a primitive type or of a type annotated
 *   <code>&#064;Immutable</code>.
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Immutable objects are inherently thread-safe; they may be passed between
 * threads or published without synchronization. Therefore instances of an
 * {@link Immutable} type are also {@link ThreadSafe}, but not necessarily visa
 * versa.
 * <p>
 * Typically, subtypes of the annotated type must be explicitly annotated
 * <code>&#064;Immutable</code> as well. It is a modeling error if they are not.
 * This annotation has two attributes, <tt>implementationOnly</tt> and
 * <tt>verify</tt>, that control how subtypes of an {@link Immutable} type must
 * be annotated. The <tt>implementationOnly</tt> attribute indicates that the
 * implementation of the annotated class should be assured without making a
 * general statement about the visible behavior of the type or its subtypes.
 * There are several rules with regards to the <tt>implementationOnly</tt>
 * attribute on {@link Immutable} types:
 * <ol>
 * <li>The <tt>implementationOnly</tt> attribute must be {@code false} when
 * {@link Immutable} appears on an interface, because interfaces do not have an
 * implementation.</li>
 * <li>The subinterfaces of an interface annotated with {@link Immutable} must
 * be annotated with {@link Immutable}; classes that implement an interface
 * annotated with {@link Immutable} must be annotated with
 * <tt>&#064;Immutable(implementationOnly=false)</tt>.</li>
 * <li>The superclass of a class annotated with
 * <tt>&#064;Immutable(implementationOnly=true)</tt> must be annotated with
 * <tt>&#064;Immutable(implementationOnly=true)</tt>; there are no constraints
 * on the subclasses.</li>
 * <li>The superclass of a class annotated with
 * <tt>&#064;Immutable(implementationOnly=false)</tt> must be annotated with
 * either <tt>&#064;Immutable(implementationOnly=false)</tt> or
 * <tt>&#064;Immutable(implementationOnly=true)</tt>; the subclasses must be
 * annotated with <tt>&#064;Immutable(implementationOnly=false)</tt>.</li>
 * </ol>
 * Finally, it may be possible to implement a class that satisfies the semantics
 * of {@link Immutable}, but that is not verifiable using the syntactic and
 * annotation constraints described above. For this case, we provide the
 * "escape hatch" of turning off tool verification for the annotation with the
 * <tt>verify</tt> attribute. For example,
 * <tt>&#064;Immutable(verify=false)</tt> would skip tool verification entirely.
 * 
 * <p>A type may not be annotated with both <code>&#064;Immutable</code>
 * and <code>&#064;Mutable</code>.
 * 
 * <h3>Relationship with <code>&#064;ThreadSafe</code></h3>
 * 
 * <p>Thread safety and immutability are two points along the same axis.  This set of 
 * annotations can actually describe three points along the axis:
 * <dl>
 *   <dt><code>&#064;Mutable</code> and <code>&#064;NotThreadSafe</code>
 *   <dd>This is the same as being unannotated, or just
 *   <code>&#064;Mutable</code>, or just <code>&#064;NotThreadSafe</code>.  The type
 *   contains mutable state that is not safe to access concurrently from
 *   multiple threads.
 *   
 *   <dt><code>&#064;Mutable</code> and <code>&#064;ThreadSafe</code>
 *   <dd>This is the same as <code>&#064;ThreadSafe</code>.  The type contains mutable 
 *   state that is safe to access concurrently from multiple threads.
 *   
 *   <dt><code>&#064;Immutable</code> and <code>&#064;ThreadSafe</code>
 *   <dd>This is the same as <code>&#064;Immutable</code>.  The type contains no mutable
 *   state, and is thus safe to access concurrently from multiple threads.
 * </dl>
 * 
 * <p>The combination <code>&#064;Immutable</code> and <code>&#064;NotThreadSafe</code> is a
 * modeling error because an immutable type is obviously thread safe.  
 * 
 * <h3>Semantics:</h3>
 * 
 * Instances of the type to which this annotation is applied are thread-safe and
 * their state cannot be seen to change by callers.
 * 
 * <h3>Examples:</h3>
 * 
 * The immutable {@code Point} class below is considered thread-safe.
 * 
 * <pre>
 * &#064;Immutable
 * public class Point {
 * 
 *   final int f_x;
 *   final int f_y;
 * 
 *   &#064;Unique(&quot;return&quot;)
 *   &#064;RegionEffects(&quot;none&quot;)
 *   public Point(int x, int y) {
 *     f_x = x;
 *     f_y = y;
 *   }
 * 
 *   &#064;RegionEffects(&quot;reads Instance&quot;)
 *   public int getX() {
 *     return f_x;
 *   }
 * 
 *   &#064;RegionEffects(&quot;reads Instance&quot;)
 *   public int getY() {
 *     return f_y;
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * A <tt>&#064;Vouch(&quot;Immutable&quot;)</tt> annotation is used to express
 * that a private array is immutable after object construction. Because the Java
 * language does not allow the programmer to express that the contents of the
 * array are unchanging, use of a {@link Vouch} is necessary in this example.
 * 
 * <pre>
 * &#064;Immutable
 * public class Aircraft {
 * 
 *   &#064;Vouch(&quot;Immutable&quot;)
 *   private final Wing[] f_wings;
 * 
 *   &#064;Unique(&quot;return&quot;)
 *   &#064;RegionEffects(&quot;none&quot;)
 *   public Aircraft() {
 *     f_wings = new Wing[2];
 *     f_wings[0] = new Wing();
 *     f_wings[1] = new Wing();
 *   }
 *   ...
 * }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <h3>Javadoc usage notes:</h3>
 * 
 * This annotation may placed in Javadoc, which can be useful for Java 1.4 code
 * which does not include language support for annotations, via the
 * <code>&#064;annotate</code> tag.
 * 
 * <pre>
 * /**
 *  * &#064;annotate Immutable
 *  *&#047;
 * public class Point {
 *   ...
 * }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * /**
 *  * &#064;annotate Immutable
 *  *&#047;
 * public class KeyTimes implements Iterable<Double> {
 *   /**
 *    * &#064;annotate Vouch(&quot;Immutable&quot;)
 *    *&#047;
 *   private final List&lt;Double&gt; f_keyTimes;
 * 
 *   ...
 * }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * /**
 *  * &#064;annotate Immutable
 *  *&#047;
 * public class Aircraft {
 * 
 *   /**
 *    * &#064;annotate Vouch(&quot;Immutable&quot;)
 *    *&#047;
 *   private final Wing[] f_wings;
 *   
 *   ...
 * }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <i>Implementation note:</i> This annotation is derived from
 * <code>&#064;Immutable</code> proposed by Brian Goetz and Tim Peierls in the
 * book <i>Java Concurrency in Practice</i> (Addison-Wesley 2006) we have simply
 * adapted it to have semantics as a promise. Further, the annotation in
 * {@code net.jcip.annotations} may be used instead of this one with the same
 * tool behavior. One difference between the two annotations is that the
 * annotation in {@code com.surelogic} adds the <tt>implementationOnly</tt> and
 * <tt>verify</tt> attributes&mdash;these attributes can not be changed from
 * their default values if the the {@code net.jcip.annotations} annotation is
 * used. Another difference is that the annotation in
 * {@code net.jcip.annotations} has retention policy of
 * {@link java.lang.annotation.RetentionPolicy#RUNTIME} while the annotation in
 * {@code com.surelogic} has a retention policy of
 * {@link java.lang.annotation.RetentionPolicy#CLASS}.
 * 
 * @see ThreadSafe
 * @see Mutable
 * @see Vouch
